This program can generate a B-spline and its first order derivative with given control points and knot sequence. The length of the B-spline, and the curvature at the given sampling point can also be calculated.

I am doing this in order to get a quick review of this language.

This program can be easily extended. For example, to find the curvature of the sampling point of B-spline, or to upgrade the B-spline to NURBS, or to construct a NURBS surface.
