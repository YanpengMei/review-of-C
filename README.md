Environment: Visual Studio 2022

Started on: 14. Feb. 2022(will be done in a month)

I will upload the whole project after finishing all the functions.

These programs can generate a B-spline with given control points and knot sequence. The length of the B-spline, and the curvature at the given sampling point can also be calculated.

I am doing this in order to get a review of this language.
