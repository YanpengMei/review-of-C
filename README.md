# Review of C language

Author: Yanpeng Mei

C environment: Visual Studio 2022

Started on: 14. Feb. 2022(will be done in a month)

I will upload the whole project after finishing all the functions.

These programs are about my thesis "Path optimization when interpolating in Numerical Controls"

This program was originally done in Matlab, but now I will rewrite part of it in C, in order to get a review of this language. Please see my Matlab version for more information.

This short version is almost the same as Python version

# Function list

1. linspace - just like the function in Matlab or Python(numpy)

2. findspan - find the knot span index

3. basisfun - basis function for B-Spline(this will be the next)

to be continued...
